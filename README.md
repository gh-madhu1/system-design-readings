# System Design Readings

A curated collection of system design resources to help you prepare for interviews and better understand scalable architectures.

## Overview

This repository contains comprehensive guides and case studies:

*   **[System Design Fundamentals](SYSTEM_DESIGN_FUNDAMENTALS.md)**:
    *   Core infrastructure concepts (Scaling, Storage, Databases)
    *   Architecture patterns (Microservices, API Gateway, CDN)
    *   Communication patterns (REST, GraphQL, gRPC, Async)
    *   Performance & Reliability (Caching, Rate Limiting)
    *   Distributed Systems (CAP Theorem, Consistency)

*   **[System Design Case Studies](SYSTEM_DESIGN_CASE_STUDIES.md)**:
    *   Real-world examples like Twitter, Netflix, Uber, WhatsApp
    *   Architecture diagrams and component breakdowns
    *   Capacity estimation and scaling strategies
    *   Key design decisions and trade-offs

## How to Use This Guide

1.  **Foundation**: Start with the `SYSTEM_DESIGN_FUNDAMENTALS.md` to build a solid understanding of the building blocks.
2.  **Application**: Move on to `SYSTEM_DESIGN_CASE_STUDIES.md` to see how these concepts are applied in real-world scenarios.
3.  **Practice**: Use the case studies as practice problems. Try to design the system yourself before reading the solution.
